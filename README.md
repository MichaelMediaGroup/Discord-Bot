This project is a Discord bot specifically for use with the Python Discord server. It provides numerous utilities and other tools. 

This bot will slowly be updated with my tutorials on building your own discord bot from the youtube channel Michael Media Group. Link to playlist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDKmb03lc0o&list=PLib_mf4mWkKUm7YVzeNvPv1wP2eI4KtRK
